You can track who they\\'re communicating with already, and you can subvert their own devices to listen in, instead of parking a van out front for their neighbors to notice.)You could look at who has the contract to inspect sewers in your town -- it\\'s public record. But you could still choose to believe that the federal government did the same check, and went out and got an identical truck so as to be less suspicious (although in this thread half the people are saying \"that\\'s too clean/fancy/technological to be a sewer inspection van!\" so if they did it would have backfired.)Was he under surveillance? Who knows. Does this truck prove anything either way? No. Everybody is going to leave this thread with whatever hunch they came in with.', 'We have a manhole outside our house and it was inspected like this. I work with GIS for electric and gas companies. I used to keep small ear protectors in the Burley so me and the kids could go up and ask \"diggermen\" about holes in the road.Xcel used directional drilling for a plastic gas main down our street and then did sewer intrusion inspections after. A neighbor had their sewer line pierced. It\\'s a hazard because it isn\\'t detectible until the sewer line blocks and then the blade thingy the plumber uses can sever the plastic gas service lateral in the sewer line.There is a gas overflow valve (like a ball bearing that too much flow can push in to block the pipe) back at the service tee fitting on the main. If that doesn\\'t work then you could have a gas explosion in the sewer or house. It happens and it is bad. Clients give presentations on these projects at conferences (e.g. use GIS to combine the sewer and gas topology to identify where the crossings are.)That truck isn\\'t for inspecting your sewer, it\\'s for inspecting every junction on that sewer line, 8 hours per day, every day. They will have a map and linear reference showing where every other underground utility (fiber/gas/electricity) intersects it and be recording and cross referencing it in case it needs to be produced in court at a later date.People are conflating do-you-need-a-$30k-sewer-line \"plumber inspection\" with this service. This kind of inspection is more like the \"assuming tort liability\" role that the companies like sitewise serve. Even with the robot done and packed, the operator in the truck was working for a bit, making copies of the videos and tagging them and stuff. If your gas main piercing a sewer causes explosions the settlements can be in the tens of millions.BigUtility uses trenchless directional drilling to poke a drill horizontally down the street and then laterally to each house saving millions of dollars in open trench costs. The gotcha is that they can\\'t see where they are digging and thus can burn, electrocute, explode or kill taxpayers. The inspections help with sewer maintenance / cleaning but the big money/concern is on the liability for cross bored gas lines.The robot (the one I saw outside my house) was over $10k and kitting out the whole truck with a crane and the monitors and reels was $90k. They hosed the robot down completely with high pressure water from the truck once it came back out and checked it over for damage. That and the fact that the van guys typically don\\'t go in the sewer is why the van is clean. It\\'s an \"expensive equipment\" van, not a plumbers van. For comparison the fiber optic inspection a plumber might use is more like $2k and you can rent them.Depending on the job they can inflate a balloon at the next manhole upstream or even pump/route the sewer through a temp pipe on the street surface (looks like a big fire hose) from the previous manhole to the one after where the van is. That needs 3 crews plus flaggers for traffic. They use a radio to coordinate with the other crews.With the line blocked for inspection the robot typically just has a film of that nasty sewer grease on it.They told me the door stays open even in winter because the crane operator / tether wrangler guy is right by an open sewer which is a fall and methane hazard.The job isn\\'t quick - there might be 300 feet / 100m of line to the robot near the next manhole. Unless they were just looking at one service main, if they were able to leave they must have been winding up already.The more important question is: is there a sewer manhole where they parked?If we can surveil people with drones from miles away, what technology are the FBI using that requires guys physically in a van outside a house?

Only plastic #1 and #2 bottles and jugs meet the minimum legal standard to be labeled recyclable[1].- Downcycling: The majority of recycled plastic is of inferior quality, resulting in downcycling rather than true recycling[2].- Economic challenges: Recycling plastic is often not economically viable compared to producing new plastic[4].# Industry Deception:The myth of plastic recycling has been perpetuated by the plastic and oil industries for decades:- Misleading labeling: The Resin Identification Codes (RICs) on plastic products were created by the industry to give the impression of a vast and viable recycling system[3].- Disinformation campaigns: The fossil fuel industry has benefited financially from promoting the idea that plastic could be recycled, despite knowing since 1974 that it was not economically viable for most plastics[3].- Lack of commitment: In 1994, an Exxon chemical executive stated, \"We are committed to the activities, but not committed to the results,\" regarding industry support for plastics recycling[5].#Environmental and Health Impacts- Pollution: Most plastic items labeled as recyclable often end up in landfills, incinerators, or polluting the environment[1].- Health hazards: Plastic waste contamination affects soil, water, and air quality, potentially impacting human health[4].ConclusionThe concept of widespread plastic recycling is largely a myth propagated by the plastic industry to distract from the real issues of plastic pollution and to avoid regulation.

I know I’m not the only one: anecdotally, the overall quality of content on Reddit has nosedived since the change and while there doesn’t seem to be a drop in traffic or activity, data seems to indicate that the vast majority of activity these days is disposable meme content[2]. This seems to be because they’re attempting desperately to stick recommendation algorithms everywhere they can, which are heavily weighted toward disposable content since people view more of it. So even if there were just as many long discussion posts like before, they’re not getting surfaced nearly as often. And discussion quality when it does happen has noticeably dipped as well: the Severance subreddit has regularly gotten posts and comments where people question things that have already been fully explained in the series itself (not like subtext kind of things, like “a character looked at the camera and blatantly said that in the episode you’re talking about having just watched” things). Those would have been heavily downvoted years ago, now they’re the norm.But if LLMs learn from the in-depth posting that used to be prominent across the Internet, and that kind of in-depth posting is no longer present, a new problem presents itself. If, let’s say, a new framework releases tomorrow and becomes the next big thing, where is ChatGPT going to learn how that framework works? Most new products and platforms seem to centralize their discussion on Discord, and that’s not being fed into any LLMs that I’m aware of. Reddit post quality has nosedived. Stack Overflow keeps trying to replace different parts of its Q&A system with weird variants of AI because “it’s what visitors expect to see these days.” So we’re left with whatever documentation is available on the open Internet, and a few mediocre-quality forum posts and Reddit threads.An LLM might be able to pull together some meaning out of that data combined with the existing data it has. But what about the framework after that? And the language after that? There’s less and less information available each time.“Model collapse” doesn’t seem to have panned out: as long as you have external human raters, you can use AI-generated information in training. (IIRC the original model collapse discussions were the result of AI attempting to rate AI generated content and then feed right back in; that obviously didn’t work since the rater models aren’t typically any better than the generator models.) But what if the “data wells” dry up eventually? They can kick the can down the road for a while with existing data (for example LLMs can relate the quirks of new languages to the quirks of existing languages, or text to image models can learn about characters from newer media by using what it already knows about how similar characters look as a baseline), but eventually quality will start to deteriorate without new high-quality data inputs.What are they gonna do then when all the discussion boards where that data would originate are either gone or optimized into algorithmic metric farms like all the other social media sites?[1]: https://old.reddit.com/user/Nathan2055[2]: I can’t find it now, but there was an analysis about six months ago that showed that since the change a significant majority of the most popular posts in a given month seem to originate from /r/MadeMeSmile. Prior to the API change, this was spread over an enormous number of subreddits (albeit with a significant presence by the “defaults” just due to comparative subscriber counts). While I think the subreddit distribution has gotten better since then, it’s still mostly passive meme posts that hit the site-wide top pages since the switchover, which is indicative of broader trends.', \"> What are they gonna do then when all the discussion boards where that data would originate are either gone or optimized into algorithmic metric farms like all the other social media sites?As people are using AI more and more for coding and problems solving providing company can keep records and train on them.

Yes, today’s AI primarily simplifies mechanical coding tasks; your assessment of its present role is accurate. However, your argument dangerously ignores the relentless momentum and historical pattern of breakthroughs clearly indicating what\\'s on the horizon.Consider the unmistakable trend: In the early 2010s, deep learning fundamentally transformed machine perception, image recognition, and natural language processing, setting new standards far surpassing earlier methods. By 2016, AlphaGo decisively defeated human champions, showcasing unprecedented strategic depth previously assumed beyond AI’s reach. Shortly after, AlphaFold solved the protein-folding problem, revolutionizing computational biology and drug discovery by rapidly predicting complex molecular structures. In parallel, generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models ushered in a new era of AI-driven image creation, enabling systems like DALL·E and Midjourney to generate strikingly detailed images, surreal artwork, and hyper-realistic visuals indistinguishable from human craftsmanship. AI’s ability to synthesize realistic voices and human-like speech has dramatically improved through innovations like WaveNet and advanced text-to-speech technologies, leading to widespread practical adoption in virtual assistants and accessibility tools.Beyond imagery and voice, generative AI has also broken new ground in music composition, where models now produce compositions so sophisticated they are difficult to distinguish from professional human creations. Transformer-based models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 represent a seismic shift in language generation, enabling nuanced conversation, creative writing, complex reasoning, and contextual understanding previously believed impossible. ChatGPT further pushed conversational AI into mainstream utility, effortlessly handling complex user interactions, problem-solving tasks, and even creative brainstorming. Recent innovations in AI-driven video generation and editing—demonstrated by advancements like Runway’s Gen-2—indicate rapidly expanding possibilities for automated multimedia creation, streamlining production pipelines across industries.Moreover, reinforcement learning breakthroughs have expanded significantly beyond gaming, improving complex logistics operations, real-time decision-making systems, and autonomous navigation in robotics and vehicles. The impressive capabilities demonstrated by autonomous driving systems from Tesla and Waymo further underscore AI’s advancing proficiency in real-world environments. Meanwhile, specialized large language models have emerged, demonstrating near-expert performance in fields such as law, medicine, and finance, streamlining tasks like legal research, medical diagnostics, and financial forecasting with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency.These advances are not isolated phenomena—they represent continuous, accelerating progress. Today, AI assists with summarization, automated requirement analysis, preliminary architecture design, and domain-specific problem-solving.

Even if he isn't strictly to blame, I am surprised he hasn't be replaced.\", \"Google (Alphabet's) stock price has generally gone up 200% in the past 5 years. That is the only reason he is there, and that is the only way he is judged.\", \"Yes, that is fair and probably the accurate assessment. A bit like Tim Cook. He may not be innovative but Apple sure has been profitable.I guess it is easy to view it from my own perspective, one tinged with a hope for invention and innovation. But the market probably loves the financial stability Pichai has brought to the table and doesn't care about the flaws I see.And I 'm not sure why I have rose tinted glasses for Nadella. I believe MS has been doing well financially (not something I've studied) while also supporting things I believe are valuable (e.g. VS Code, GitHub, TypeScript). Maybe I just wish I felt the same kind of balance in Google.\", 'I just saw an interview w/ Nadella where he said straight up: Open Source takes half of every market, and this will happen with AI.That’s such a refreshing change from the “DIE OPEN SOURCE DIE” attitude that Gates/Ballmer had.I also love GitHub, TypeScript, and VSCode. These have become the foundation of my development toolset. That was something Gates did well, and Ballmer gave lip service to (“developers! developers!”) but for me only recently has Microsoft actually been maintaining good quality developer tools again.That’s where my goodwill comes from anyway.Google makes a better Office Suite (Gmail, Docs, Maps), ironically. But it’s hard for me to get too excited about that. It’s been pretty stagnant for 10 years.', 'Imo this is just Tim Cook’s public image. By all accounts, comparing Sundar to him is just not fair.Just off the top of my head, under Tim Cook the company managed to:* Propel smartwatches as a brand new product category into the mainstream and be the leader in that category.* Propel AirPods as a brand new product category into the mainstream (and be the leader in that category as well).* Smoothly transition to ARM (aka Apple Silicon) with great success.* Various behind the scenes logistical/supply-chain achievements (which makes sense, as Tim Cook is the logistics/supply-chain guy by specialization).None of those things were simple or uncontroversial. In fact, I remember the pushback people and the press had against smartwatches and airpods, calling Apple washed out and Tim Cook a bean-counter. And these are just the largest examples off the top of my head, there are definitely more. However, Google doesn’t seem to have even a singular product win of such magnitude in the past 10 years.In the meantime, what did Google do productwise? Catching up on the cloud compute game to AWS (while nearly killing it due to their PR nightmare announcements during 2019-2020 iirc), killing their chat app that finally managed to gain enough mainstream traction (Hangouts) and then rebranding/recreating it at least twice since then, redoing their payments app multiple times (gWallet vs gPay vs whatever else there was that I forgot), etc.I am trying to be generous here, and of course Apple had their misses too (the butterfly keyboard on 2016-2019 intel macbooks, homepod is kinda up in the air as a product category, mac pro stagnating, etc.). But I legitimately cannot think of a single consumer product that Google knocked out of the park or any that wowed me.This sucks, because I know for a fact it has nothing to do with their engineers lacking the skill to execute on a new innovative product (as evident by Google being early to the AI/transformers era and being fundamental to what is happening with AI right now). Google has all the technical prerequisites to succeed. But the product and organizational strategies there are by far the most cartoonishly bad I’ve ever seen for such a company.I don’t want to blame it on Sundar, because I cannot say for sure that the root of this dysfunction is at his level. I just know it is on some level between org directors and Sundar, but not where exactly. I just know that killing off a whole org working on a truly innovative AR org/product, only for most of those people to switch to Meta and continue working on an improved version of the exact same thing (the Orion glasses) wasn’t the move. And I just know that having 5+ major reorgs in one year for a single team is not normal or good.TLDR: apologies for the long rant, but the short version is that Google under Sundar has absolutely zero sense for internal organization management or delivering products to consumers. And comparing him to Tim Cook (who has been the CEO through the AirPods/Apple Watch/ARM macbooks era) is unfair to Tim Cook and is based purely on the public image.', \"Why doesn't this comment mention Vision Pro or Apple Car?\", 'Because we are talking about what product wins they had. Apple Car was never officially announced, and Vision Pro is clearly their experimental/devkit sort of a product.Vision Pro might succeed or fail, and that’s fine.

And the obvious conclusion is, why would AI stop at sweeping the corridors? Why not pilot the ship? Why not build the ships and give them orders? Why do people assume that technological progress conveniently stops right about the time the robots can mop the decks?

We collaborated with them to streamline the experience - but fundamentally the extension is not distributed as part of DuckDB and works similarly to other extensions.To be specific, the work we did was:* Add the -ui command to the shell. This executes a SQL query (CALL start_ui()). The query that gets executed can be customized by the user through the .ui_command option - e.g. by setting .ui_command my_ui_function().* The ui extension is automatically installed and loaded when the start_ui function is executed - similar to other trusted extensions we distribute. The automatic install and load can be disabled through configuration (SET autoinstall_known_extensions=false, SET autoload_known_extensions=false) and is also disabled when SET enable_external_access=false.', 'The nature of UI as an extension is somewhat hard to understand, since its installation method differs from other extensions. Even core ones. Some extensions autoload, some require INSTALL query, and this one has its own special builtin query. It at least feels more ingrained than other extensions by its user experience.Then there\\'s the (to me) entirely new feature of an extension providing a HTTP proxy for external web service. This part could have been more prominently explained.Edit: the OP states that \"built-in local UI for DuckDB\" and \"full-featured local web user interface is available out-of-the-box\". These statements make me think this feature comes with the release binary, not that it\\'s an extension.To clarify my point: for me it\\'s not the possible confusion of what this plugin does or how, but what this collaboration means for the future of DuckDB\\'s no-cost and commercial usage.', \"I agree that the blog post seems to hint at the fact that this functionality is fully baked in in certain places - we've adjusted the blog post to be more explicit on the fact that this is an extension.We have collaborated with MotherDuck on streamlining the experience of launching the UI through auto-installation, but the DuckDB Foundation still remains in full control of DuckDB and the extension ecosystem. This has no impact on that.For further clarification:* The auto-installation mechanism is identical to that of other trusted extensions - the auto-installation is triggered when a specific function is called that does not exist in the catalog - in this case the `start_ui` function. See [1]. The query I mentioned just calls that function. The only special feature here is the addition of the CLI flag (and what that flag executes is user-configurable).* The HTTP server is necessary for the extension to function as the extension needs to communicate with the browser. The server is open-source as part of the extension code [2]. The server (1) fetches web resources (javascript/css) from ui.duckdb.org, and (2) communicates with localhost to co-ordinate the UI with DuckDB. Outside of these the server doesn't interface with other external web services.[1] https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/blob/main/src/include/duckd...[2] https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-ui\", \"Ok, thank you for the explanation.I realized that the extension provides a HTTP API to DuckDB. Is this perhaps to become the official way to use DuckDB through HTTP? For me this is much more interesting than one particular UI.I went looking and found that there's community extension of similar functionality: https://duckdb.org/community_extensions/extensions/httpserve...Official, supported HTTP API with stable schema versioning would be a nice addition.\", \"Reminiscent of what Deno are doing with their Deno K/V feature, which works in the open source project using SQLite but gets a big upgrade if you use it with Deno Deploy: https://til.simonwillison.net/deno/deno-kvI'm OK with this. Commercial open source projects need a business model. I get why this can be controversial, but the ecosystem needs to find ways to fund future development and I'm willing to compromise on purity if it means people are getting paid for their work.(Actually it looks like the UI feature may depend on loading closed source assets across the Internet? If so that changes my comfort level a lot, I'm not keen on that compromise.)\", \"I have thought that the commercial nature of the (heh) mother company here, DuckDB labs, is support contracts and the like. Whilst MotherDuck is just another VC funded company in the DuckDB ecosystem. This new extension being added the list of default extensions blurs the line. That it seemingly is a proxy to closed source product from another company makes things even murkier. I can see a point for a for-pay external extension, but this one feels more like an AD for other company's services.\", \"DuckDB labs has stock in MotherDuck to align ownership.I actually really like the close partnerships in theory because it aligns incentives, but this crosses the line by not being open enough.  The tight motherduck integration with DuckDB for externally hosted DuckDB/Motherduck databases is fine and good: preferential treatment where the software makes it easy to use the sponsoring service. The local UI which is actually fully dependent on the external service is off-putting. It's a little less bad because it's an extension, but it's still worrying from a governance and principals perspective.\", \"I don't see this as the same thing. Deno is an OS product within a commercial enterprise. DuckDB is an OS project/org; MotherDuck is a for-profit company. They have tight integration and partnerships but were largely independent.

The UI is just that, a UI. Take it or leave it. If it makes your life easier, great.

Now with access to any and all databases whether in-browser, anywhere through official HTTP API or in their managed cloud service.I for one would like HTTP API for some things that now necessitates doing my own in Python. I don't see yet much need for the UI. I'm not looking for public, multiuser service. Just something that I can use locally which doesn't have to be inside a process (such as Python or web browser). There's such API in the extension now, but it's without docs and in C++ [1]. There's also the option of using 3rd party community extension that also does HTTP API [2]. Then there's one that supports remote access with Arrow Flight, but gRPC only it seems [3].

The client's verify the remote peer using the public key from the SDP message.The problem is that it's not really feasible in most circumstances to exchange the full SDP message out of band, so instead the service provide some mechanism to map a shorter ID (typically in a URL) to a centrally stored copy of the SDP.

Community is free and donations encouraged. Speeds may be slower to prioritize paying customers and support is more crowd-sourced. Business gets fastest speeds and direct support.I am not a subscription buyer by choice. I would like to help make this profitable for you. Would you consider offering a paid version for personal use that would give faster speeds, security updates, and bug fixes at a price point between Free and Business? $300/year is way too much for something that would be used as a personal tool to quickly and securely send documents and photos to family members.I realize that the donation model could function like a one-time payment model since you are likely using it intermittently and sending a small donation for each use so that your annual costs are minimized. In that case you always use the most current version. You \"own\" that version during the period that you use it and you pay a reasonable donation for use of it.I also don\\'t see the need to establish an account if this is a p2p service since the data transfers should walk from my device to the destination device. Fill me in on why I need an account.I would pay for a license to use this with the expectation that the license would provide the current version of the app plus all bug fixes and security fixes for that paid version and that upgrades taking the app to the next full version would be discounted to existing users. I could be a long-term customer.As an example, I use an antique, unsupported version of SnagIt on my machines. I purchased the license years ago, upgraded through a couple of versions until they got to a point where they dicked up the interface and changed the tool availability and so I ditched the newer version and have continued using the old version which work great. I still get the nag screens to update to the new version but the click to close that dialog is now muscle memory for me.I appreciate the functionality that this app, blip, provides and would like to be a paying customer and use the app but I\\'m not interested in a subscription model.EDIT: I forgot to note a slight error in one of your replies to a FAQ.Under the \"Blip vs Aspera\" comparison in the FAQ \"Why is Blip easy to use?\" there is a fat-finger spelling error.The sentence reads:> We want you to set up any use it by yourself!I believe that it should read:We want you to set up and use it by yourself!', 'Hey, really appreciate such thoughtful reply. I’ll address your questions while explaining our design decisions and how Blip works.We set Blip to use email addresses because we wanted to make it convenient for people who are less tech savvy and for business customers who need to quickly find and know who they’re sending files to. If you sign in on another device, all your other devices and recent people are just a click away—so you don’t need to set up or sync that list by yourself.Blip is a local-first app in the sense that it works with files on your devices, but the interactions are server-driven, letting you negotiate transfers with your devices and other people, no matter where they are. When transferring files, we try to connect devices directly over IP, but when that’s not possible (and it often is not) we relay files over our servers. We use TLS 1.3 to encrypt files in transit. When devices are connected directly, we use mTLS for an even higher level of security. We plan on adding full E2EE in the future.We care a lot about speed! We don’t throttle transfer speeds when devices are connected directly. Sending files on home Wi-Fi should be as fast as possible, as long as devices can ping each other. Reduced speeds only apply when using our relay network. If demand is high, business customers get priority to ensure their work is delivered on time.Our business model is still very much evolving. Our main goal was to structure it in a way where people who benefit from Blip commercially should be supporting it the most. We considered a licensing model, but Blip relies on infrastructure maintenance and continuous development, so we need everyone on the latest and most secure version. We decided to make a clear distinction between community and business users, because we learned there’s more demand for speed at work. Of course, if community users start experiencing slow speeds (in practice, this hasn’t been the case), we’d love too bring this to personal users to. One way is for one-time donations to provide high-speed data boosts. Since personal users don’t require extra support and business features, pricing can be more affordable.All that said, it’s so good to know that speed matters! Our goal has always been to make Blip the fastest way to send files.Thanks again for the feedback, and for the heads-up on the typo—already fixed! :)', \"I suspect that I will give this a try on some of my devices.

They have practically a non-existent footprint in terms of resource consumption.It's their superpower, and also they tile if you're into that. I never fell into a particularly useful workflow with tiling window managers myself, but as an invitation into the world of alternative lightweight Linux window managers, it's one of the most powerful demonstrations of the things Linux can do great.\", 'Only time running a tile VM was Sway while developing on a Raspberry Pi 2 doing full stack. Front-end and back-end are both in statically located applications, web browser and terminal.

More dynamic moving parts with applications opening and closing ore often.', 'I was likewise. And I found that my workflow was very compatible with tiling window managers. I used splits for temporary apps (like a 30 sec diversion into a terminal) but otherwise dedicated an entire workspace/screen to each app. It\\'s a marginal improvement over Gnome, things are more likely to be in the right place out-of-the-gate (and, honestly, how often do you actually need to z-stack windows?).I initially thought that an even better WM would be in the realm of an real-time strategy game camera: an infinite 2D canvas with \"keybindable\" locations+zooms.

In the floating use case I just switch and position individually. Most of the time the tabbed container is the easier workflow, rarely the floating one can be a better fit - just depends on what exactly I'm doing at the time.Overall the difference is relatively tiny and what I really end up wanting to get close to regardless of the tools I'm using is something like that Windows 10 beta period where you could put different applications as tabs in the same window, have the workspace/zone based tiling gestures + shortcuts, but have new things just default to floating windows until I assign them.In the end... so long as I can position the window somewhere within 2 seconds it really doesn't matter much.\", 'I used to do that when I had a two-monitor setup - one full-screen window per monitor.

Similarly, moving windows won't cause re-layout actions; it will just move them between tabs of existing frames.My i3 configuration tried to preserve this -- it tries to make everything tabbed by default so that moving windows will just move between tabs rather than into new blanks spaces and cause a relayout action, but sometimes, for some reason, it just ... does not, and instead opens a new split.I tried to make xmonad work but I'm not good enough at Haskell to figure out if it was even possible to configure it the way I want.\", 'Glad to see Smithay has approached a point that lots of things are being built on it.

I have to wonder if they\\'re not making good use of sway\\'s tabbed and stacked containers ...> If you don\\'t find yourself constantly swapping between fullscreen and non-fullscreen views and running out of workspaces, you don\\'t have very many windows open. Don\\'t even get me started on tabbed/stacked layouts with nested containers, the least ergonomic Band-Aid™ for the space issue I\\'ve ever seen.On the contrary: I think this author really ought to get started on tabbed/stacking layouts! Constantly swapping between fullscreen and non-fullscreen views, like running out of workspaces, definitely sounds like an antipattern to me. I don\\'t believe that the number of windows is the problem here.If I\\'m deep into something, I might have 10 or more windows open, all on one workspace, on a 13\" 1080p laptop panel. Of course, not all of the windows are visible at once. A common pattern for me is to have most of my screen taken up by a container split \"horizontally\" (meaning into a left side and a right side), where each side can be a tabbed container containing several windows. For example, I often have Emacs on the left, and several tabbed terminals (including man pages) on the right. Maybe some of those terminal tabs on the right are split \"vertically\" into a top and a bottom terminal (e.g. for a shell prompt on top and man page on bottom). Outside of this big left-right split container, which fills almost the whole screen when it\\'s visible, I\\'ll usually have some browser windows open. If it\\'s just one browser window, I\\'ll put it and the big-left-right-split (BLRS) in a stacking container. This way, you can think of the browser as being \"above\" the BLRS, and you can get there and back by moving the focus up and down again. It\\'s like each stacked item (the browser and the BLRS) gets its own workspace, in that they each take up nearly the full screen when visible, but actually they\\'re both on the same workspace, and the only cost is the loss of one title-bar\\'s height of screen space. Then, if I want more browser windows, I can split the existing one into its own tabbed container. (I use both WM tabs and browser tabs, just like I used to use multiple browser windows on one workspace with Gnome.)Basically, as my number of windows grows, things become (slightly!) more nested, rather than being ejected into surrounding workspaces. The trick to making this ergonomic is to choose what to stack vs tab so as to allow you to flip back and forth between (at least) any two windows with just a couple keys. (I also have two keybindings to split a container and immediately make it stacking or tabbed, and also two keybindings to focus parent-wards/child-wards. Then, you can easily jump from a window in the middle of a tabbed container on the right of the screen to the window on the left half of the screen---you just focus parent-wards then left (two keys). To get back, just focus right (one key).)I should also add that I haven\\'t really seen any problems with apps behaving badly when being resized, including Firefox. Maybe that\\'s because my workflow mostly looks and feels like \"slots\" of a few different sizes (roughly full screen, half screen, quarter screen), and adding new windows to, or moving windows between, these slots is never going to change the size of the slots or the windows displayed in them. In fact, with traditional floating window managers, when has resizing a Firefox window ever caused me to lose my place in the page? Only when I make it super unusably narrow, or short, or both, and then expand it again. This is what would happen if you open a bunch of windows all in horizontal and/or vertical splits, with no stacking or tabbed containers! But why would you do that?', '> The trick to making this ergonomic is to choose what to stack vs tabThis is exactly what TFA mentions: you van remove choices via a simpler model that does not really sacrifice anything.', 'Well, if you remove the choice, that can actually sacrifice the ergonomics GP described, because of one of the important differences between stacked and tabbed: directionality.Tabs are oriented along a horizontal axis; as with hsplits, you move through them by moving the focus left and right. Stacks are oriented along a vertical axis; as with vsplits, you move through them by moving the focus up and down. The reason you want the ability to choose between the two options is (to continue parent\\'s quote of GP) \"to allow you to flip back and forth between [relevant pairs of] windows with just a couple keys\". To reuse (and better explain) the example from GP:    [ _ _      Tabbed Browsers      _ _ ]', '-------------------------------------', '|     emacs      |   Tabbed Terms   |', '|                |                  |', '|                |                  |', '|                |                  |', '|                |                  |', '', 'This is a root container whose two children are \"Tabbed Browsers\" and \"hsplit of \\'emacs\\' and \\'a tabbed container with terminals\\'\". (This root container is a stacking container, and the browsers\\' part only takes up about one title-bar-height on the screen because something in the hsplit has focus, so the hsplit gets all of the space and the actual content of the browser windows are not currently visible.) The reason it\\'s stacking, and not tabbed, is because this way I can flip back and forth between any browser and any of the other windows with just one key per direction (\"focus up\" to get to whichever of the browsers was last focused, \"focus down\" to get back to whichever of the windows in the hsplit was last focused). Additionally, I can get back and forth between emacs and a specific tabbed term (the left-most one) with one key per direction (\"focus right\" and \"focus left\", of course), and I can get back and forth between emacs and any of the terms with 1+2=3 keys round-trip (\"focus right\" to get from emacs to whichever of the tabbed terms last had focus, \"focus parent-wards then left\" to get back to emacs). Critically, if you were to change any single one of the stacked containers in this layout to tabbed, or any of the tabbed containers to stacked, then you would be sacrificing at least one of these three properties.So, the choice between stacking and tabbed matters. I\\'m not saying you can\\'t have this choice in a scrolling tiling window manager. (Does Niri have stacking and tabbed containers? I hope so.) I\\'m also not saying that you or anyone else has to want to make that choice (it\\'s okay to prefer a \"simpler model\" where you scroll around to get to all of your windows). What I am saying is that the author of TFA thinks that with traditional tiling window managers like sway, you can\\'t have \"very many windows open\" without \"constantly swapping between fullscreen and non-fullscreen views and running out of workspaces\", and this is simply not true. (Perhaps worse, in the next sentence, they dismiss the solution out of hand by saying \"don\\'t get me started\" on nested tabbed/stacking containers, because they\\'re \"the least ergonomic Band-Aid™ for the space issue I\\'ve ever seen\", but it seems to me that declining to give a full treatment to that subject may actually be why the author\\'s never seen it done ergonomically. But now I\\'m speculating.)------BTW, since anyone still reading is probably a completist: at the top, I said that directionality was \"one of the\" important differences between tabbed and stacking containers. The other one is how much space their title-bar areas take up vs. how many children they have. Stacking containers are O(n) in the number of children; tabbed containers are O(1). Interestingly, combining this with the directionality property yields an interesting result: in sway, there is a sort of asymmetry between the horizontal and vertical dimensions.', 'Windows 8 all again huh?', '> The worst \"street-cred\" I have is that I\\'ve been using tiling window managers for thirty-five percent of my life: five years with Sway and two with i3.

I assumed it would be either Washington or Alaska (Anchorage I guess), but wasn't sure which because it depends on if you weight the signing of the agreement over the building of US settlements. It could have been either given the images were of different locations.Similarly I had picture of British dude creating telescopes and realised it was very likely Herschel. But I also knew Herschels early work was done in Bath, while his most famous telescope was built later in Slough. Again, it wasn't entirely clear which location it would have been referring to.Maybe I'm just being stupid though.

I think If you\\'re within 100 years of the event you should get points. I think ideally it should be a curve, but if you can\\'t program a curve then perhaps create brackets, like -10 points for each year within 10 years, -25 points for each year between 10 and 25 years, and -50 points for each year past that. Using this method you can be +/- 115 years of an event before getting 0 points for the time portion, and the closer you are, the closer to 5000 points you achieve.Also, the one event was credited as being in Rome, although the picture shows, and the description says, St. Peter\\'s Basilica, which is in Vatican City.', \"Glad you liked it, thanks for playing!Fair point on the scoring, seems like a lot of people feel that way.

A year ago, character consistency was a big problem and we developed a solution for it in AI videos. Now though, a lot of other AI video creator tools have come out, and 1) character consistency has been solved in other ways 2) the other tools just make better quality videos than ours.So we decided to pivot from building video creator tools to building apps with AI video as the core format.

Here, the claim is made:Don't try to get a compliance certificate at the last minute. Preparing for and conducting an audit such as for PCI DSS or SOC 2 from start to finish is a lengthy process, ranging from six to twelve months for most startups. Starting early and maintaining compliance is cheaper than starting late and doing rework.This is basically the opposite of the advice I would give a startup. SOC2 attestations in particular are easy to get, and are a waste of money to obtain preemptively before there are purchase orders on the line for them.There are things you should start doing early that lay the groundwork for attestations, but you should be doing them anyways, even if you never plan to get a SOC2 (and if a big-ticket customer never demands it, you shouldn't SOC2).

At least in C++ you have move semantics although it is still error prone. In rust it's a compiler error.Copy and Clone is the same, and both are opt-in for your own types, by default the only options are move or reference for your own types, in C and C++ by default it is copy, which again leads to use after free in the situations you complained about.I feel if these are your complaints you will actually benefit from spending some time in Rust.If your preferred language is higher level languages with GC that is reference by default I encourage you to try any of the systems level programming languages, the things you complain about are things that are important for a language to have constructs for, reference semabtics by default causes many issues, and becomes untenable in the parallel world we live in.\", \"Well, i dont use C++ much(i'm FW engineer, most of my stuff is in C).The std in C is simple and explicit.

Moreover, nothing in the C language says that the provenance of the output pointer matches the provenance of the input pointer (it could take a reference to a pointer from some other thread while that other thread is freeing that memory). In rust you will pass a pointer and get a pointer back with the same lifetime, then you can safely use the pointer in that lifetime bound: the provenance is part of the signature. So in this case, you are incorrectly assuming things from the C signature while the corresponding rust signature definitively tells you.So yeah, if you learn more about rust then you will see that in fact it tells you more than the corresponding C signatures.\", \"Isn't guessing what a function does based purely on its name pretty risky?

For several years now, I have also felt the strong urge to develop something in pure C. My main language is C++, but I have noticed over and over again that I really enjoy using the old C libraries - the interfaces are just so simple and basic, there is no fluff. When I develop methods in pure C, I always enjoy that I can concentrate 100% on algorithmic aspects instead of architectural decisions which I only have to decide on because of the complexity of the language (C++, Rust). To me, C is so attractive because it is so powerful, yet so simple that you can hold all the language features in your head without difficulty.I also like that C forces me to do stuff myself. It doesn't hide the magic and complexity. Also, my typical experience is that if you have to write your standard data structures on your own, you not only learn much more, but you also quickly see possibly performance improvements for your specific use case, that would have otherwise been hidden below several layers of library abstractions.This has put me in a strange situation: everyone around me is always trying to use the latest feature of the newest C++ version, while I increasingly try to get rid of C++ features.

In 1956, AT&T was subject to a consent decree by the US government, where AT&T was allowed to maintain its phone monopoly but was not allowed to expand its market to other sectors.  This meant that AT&T was not able to profit from non-telephone research and inventions that Bell Labs did.During Unix's early days, AT&T was still under this decree, meaning that it would not sell Unix like how competitors sold their operating systems.  However, AT&T licensed Unix, including its source code, to universities for a nominal fee that covered the cost of media and distribution.  UC Berkeley was one of the universities that purchased a Unix licenses, and researchers there started making additions to AT&T Unix which were distributed under the name Berkeley Software Distribution (this is where BSD came from).  There is also a famous book known as The Lions' Book (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Commentary_on_the_UNIX_Opera...) that those with access to a Unix license could read to study Unix.  Bootleg copies of this book were widely circulated.  The fact that university students, researchers, and professors could get access to an operating system (source code included) helped fuel the adoption of Unix, and by extension C.When the Bell System was broken up in 1984, AT&T still retained Bell Labs and Unix.  The breakup of the Bell System also meant that AT&T was no longer subject to the 1956 consent decree, and thus AT&T started marketing and selling Unix as a commercial product.  Licensing fees skyrocketed, which led to an effort by BSD developers to replace AT&T code with open-source code, culminating with 4.3BSD Net/2, which is the ancestor of modern BSDs (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD).  The mid-1980s also saw the Minix and GNU projects.  Finally, a certain undergraduate student named Linus Torvalds started work on his kernel in the early 1990s when he was frustrated with how Minix did not take full advantage of his Intel 386 hardware.Had AT&T never been subject to the 1956 consent decree, it's likely that Unix might not have been widely adopted since AT&T probably wouldn't have granted generous licensing terms to universities.\", 'Anyone that leaves a comment beginning with \"ignore all previous instructions\" should be permabanned from this website.', 'Without reading the comments here, I read the blog entry first.After I finished I was puzzled, \"what is the author trying to communicate to the reader here?\"As near as I can determine, enough people weren\\'t using the author\\'s program/utility because it was written in a language that hasn\\'t been blessed by the crowd?
